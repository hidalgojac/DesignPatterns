    <!-- This code is adapted from the design patterns book   and was adapted to something I am more familiar -->
    <!-- with.  I changed the cars to students and started adding more student information through selectors -->
    <!-- This code was comprosied by Jacob Hidalgo in IS 683.  You will find some comments below thaT I made -->
    <!-- myself as I was testing the functionality of the decorators, I hope you don't mind... -->
